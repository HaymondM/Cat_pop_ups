# Cat Pop Up

Please note that this program is for educational purposes only 

This program has the purpose of being fun. It pops up a window with a button. Next to the button is a timer. The longer a user waits to press the button, the bigger the surprise. When the button is pressed, images of cats are spread across the users screen. Important! You will have to use Task Manager to close the program.
